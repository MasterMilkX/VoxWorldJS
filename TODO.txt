TODO
[X] Create a .py script that takes the images in "textures/" and prints them to a JSON file as a array (command in bash is: `ls -1 | sed -e 's/\.png$//'`)
[X] Import 3D arrays for structures as a npy or txt file
[X] Allow importing both structures and texture presetting together as a single JSON file
[X] Actually 3d render the objects lol
[X] Export to PNG + GIF
[X] Allow height changes
[X] Headless Node.JS version of the code -> (look at https://npm.io/package/node-canvas-webgl and headless-gl)
    - if node-canvas errors out do this 
    1. goto node-modules/canvas/
    2. run `npm install --build-from-source`
    - try also `brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg`
